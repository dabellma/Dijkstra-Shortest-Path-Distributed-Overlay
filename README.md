In this assignment I created TCP connections by spawning threads on different nodes so nodes could communicate with each other. Once the connections were created on multiple nodes, multiple simulated network packets were created and routed according to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. See README in overlay folder for more details on the java classes that made this happen.
